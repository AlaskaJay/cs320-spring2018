title: "Project: Physical MOdel Website and Database"

Project Summary
===============
A website and database that would allow engineering faculty to post descriptions and plans for the physical models that they use in their courses to demonstrate topics, concepts, and principles that they are teaching.  This site would not only be used by York College faculty, but could also be made available to anyone wishing to post a physical model, or find / request a physical model for any topic of interest.

Here is a collection of [physical models for engineering education](Physical_models_and_demos_in_engineering_education.pdf) put together by Dave Flaherty at the University of Colorado.

Here is a [PowerPoint presentation](Physical_Model_Website_Database.pdf) that gives an overview of a possible GUI implementation and navigation for the website.

For more information on this project, please see Dr. Scott Hamilton, Civil Engineering Coordinator.
