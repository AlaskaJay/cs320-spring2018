## News

<!--
* **Mar 29** - The midterm exam will be in-class on **Friday, 4-7-17**.  It will be open notes and you can use any resource on the CS320 website, as well as your lab solutions.  A practice exam will be posted over the weekend.  We will use Wednesday, 4-5-17, to go over an end-to-end solution for the books database we've been working with, as well as review for the exam.

* **Mar 25** - [Individual Project Milestone2](assign/assign04.html) is due Monday, April 10th.  This will be a 3-4 minute in-class demonstration of your progress since Milestone 1.

* **Mar 25** - [Team Project Milestone 2](assign/assign03.html) is due Monday, April 3rd.  This will be a 10-minute (max) in-class team presentation/demonstration of your team's progress since milestone 1.  SQL database functionality is **NOT** required for this milestone (but **IS** required for the third milestone.)

* **Mar 24** - [Lab06: ORM](labs/lab06.html) is posted.  It is due **Friday, 3-31-17**.

This will be an 8-10 minute (max) in-class team presentation/demonstration of your team's progress on your UI structure and navigation.  You should have the vast majority of your servlets and JSPs defined, and be able to navigate between most, if not all, of your pages.  Your HTML/CSS will still be in a rough state - don't worry about making it "pretty", focus on functionality over form.
